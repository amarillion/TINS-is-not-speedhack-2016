Lands of magic

Match each Kanji and go throught all 4 levels to win
( craft & utf8 )
Don't wait and be quick if you want to finish in
( poetry )
If you search for air, water, fire of snow
In the meanings of kanjis lie the anwser of below 

Here lies my poor tins's a* rules player
Your have to find the path in each slice
That year sure was not easy with the timer
Hell it's 02:13 and I'm on poetry 'out spice

TINS 2016 FTW
