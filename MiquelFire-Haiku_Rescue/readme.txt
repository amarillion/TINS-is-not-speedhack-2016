You been tasked with delivering slips of paper with haiku written on them.
During your travels, someone rips them up and throws them into a field.
You must go through the magically changing field and collect the missing pieces.
To beat a level, you must combine the pieces of paper. 4 levels in all.

Mouse for EVERYTHING! Click where you want to go, and your character moves there.
Once you collect all the pieces to a single haiku, the game will display it to you.

Technical requirements

	technical rule #48: path finding
		When you click somewhere, the character will attempt to move left or right to get to the spot.
		When he gets there or block, moves up and down instead
		If he was blocked, he'll move left or right again once cleared.
		He not smart enough to do more than that however.
	
	technical rule #55: use unicode to display non-english characters (e.g. russian, japanese).

		You get a translation at underneath however. (Font is a bit iffy)

Bonus rules

	bonus rule #3: Act of Formaldehyde: you can opt out of a rule if instead you decide to follow three other rules from a previous Speedhack/TINS. The rules page containing those rules should still be up for all to see.

		Ratio friendly rule from SH 2007 (Every TINS and SH I made used this since however ;) )
		No third rule knowly used, so can't use this.
