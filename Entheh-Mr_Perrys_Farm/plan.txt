Possible game name: Mr Perry's Farm

Set on a farm.
Everything is narrated with Dr Seuss style poetry.
Different weather conditions are available (this is how we incorporate snow).

Tile map game, with a setup phase and a play phase.
In the play phase, you have animals walking around the map.
In the setup phase, you can place food down to entice the animals - in play phase they pathfind towards the nearest item until it's collected.
Different animals are attracted by different food.

You also build a machine in the setup phase.
The machine has a central core and four stubs for adding components to.
You can use the central core to specify the direction the machine will go first.

In the play phase, the machine will move in the direction indicated.
Upon hitting something (animal, wall or item), the component doing the hitting will activate.
Components available are:
- Bomb (destroys animals and items near it)
- Localised weather effect (rain speeds animals up; sun slows them down; snow makes them slip around)
- Direction changer
