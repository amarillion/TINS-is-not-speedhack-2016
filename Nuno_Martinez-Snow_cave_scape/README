============
Introduction
============

  This is my entry for TINS 2016.

  It's much like Lucasarts Point'n'click adventures.  Use the mouse to select
  the action or the object.

  I have a very few time to build the game from scratch (no engine!) so be
  nice with me.  If you use action "use", keep mouse over the second
  object/place until action is finished.  If not, your avatar will not remember
  what he was going to do.  I know: he's pretty stupid.  Well, he's trapped
  in a cave in the south pole (Snow accomplished!!!).

  I would like to finish the game.  Keep an eye to my TINS log and/or my
  websites where I'll talk about this.

============
Installation
============

  I think there's everything needed in the ZIP.

  Windows 32bit executable is at directory "bin".  It should work on Linux+Wine.



===========
Compilation
===========

  You'll need Free Pascal.

  Open a console and go to the project directory.  In most cases just use
  "cd project".

  Execute "fix.bat" on Windows or "./fix.sh" on GNU/Linux and follow the
  on screen instructions.

  Execute the "make" command.  This should create the executable files.
  If you have problems contact me (see websites in introduction).

  Execute "make help" to see all available options.
